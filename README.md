# DIS-Project-Lensed-Galaxy
We apply score-based diffusion models to strong gravitational lensing, reconstructing posterior distributions of background galaxies from noisy, contaminated observations. This Bayesian approach enables image-level uncertainty quantification and offers insights for both dark matter studies and trustworthy AI image generation.
